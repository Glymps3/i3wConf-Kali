Oh hey I'm Glymps3 a white hat security researcher.

this first repo is simply an enviroment i prefer.



This is my personal i3w conf with a semi sanitized config file as well as 
picom config and i3status config its my favorite window manager for 
laptops running any linux.... but I prefer Kali. 

 
Honestly this README is longer than the configs.
