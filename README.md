This is my personal i3w conf with a semi sanitized config file as well as 
picom config and i3status config its my favorite window manager for 
laptops running any debian based distro.... but I prefer Kali. 
 
the vimrc would be changed to ~/.vimrc

<<<<<<< HEAD
you are free to organize your files however you like,
but you do need i3, i3status, tmux, and picom for theese 
conf files to be effective.

Honestly this README is longer than the configs.
